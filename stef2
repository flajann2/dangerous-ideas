In the podcasts, you will find that Stefan Molyneux either discuss politics and current events such as current situation in Hongkong, or he talks to many indivuals about their personal problems in his efforts to help them understand them better. He not once has ever declared the superiorty of one race over another, but has spoken to the tons of research on IQ and has spoken to many experts in the field. And the data indicates that Asians tend to be the ones in the highest IQ ranks in the world. It does not means that Asians, as a "race" is superior to the rest of us. It simply means that nature by way of evolutiuon has edged the hump of their bell curve to be slightly higer than the rest of us. 

== Background ==
Molyneux was born in Ireland and raised mainly in [[London]] before moving to Canada at age 11.<ref name=Mississauga-2003 /> He attended [[Glendon College]] at [[York University]] in Toronto, where he was an actor at Theatre Glendon<ref name=Star-23Feb1988 /> and a member of the Debating Society.<ref name=ProTem-8Feb1988 /> He then attended the [[National Theatre School of Canada]] in Montreal.<ref name=Mississauga-2003 /><ref name=Burg-Star /> In 1991, at age 25, Molyneux received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in History from [[McGill University]]. He received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in History from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1993.<ref name=Globe-2008 /><ref name=Burg-Star />

Molyneux describes himself as an [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] and a [[philosopher]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html|title=The Making of a YouTube Radical|last=Roose|first=Kevin|date=2019-06-08|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2019-06-08|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.is/yV88p|archive-date=2019-06-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Academic philosophers do not take the idea  of Molyneux as a philosopher seriously. American philosopher [[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]] wrote of Molyneux's book ''Universally Preferable Behavior: A Rational Proof for Secular Ethics'' that, "He fails, and fails miserably. His arguments are often preposterously bad."<ref name=philosophy1>{{cite web|title=The Molyneux Problem|url=https://mises.org/library/molyneux-problem|date=7 April 2012|author=David Gordon}}</ref>

== Career ==
In early 1995, Molyneux and his brother Hugh founded Caribou Systems Corporation, a Toronto-based provider of environmental database software. The company was sold in 2000.<ref name="Burg-Star"/><ref name="2002-01-28_Blue292"/>

In 2005, Molyneux began writing articles for the American libertarian website ''[[LewRockwell.com]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/author/stefan-molyneux/ |title=Articles by Stefan Molyneux |website=LewRockwell.com |access-date=25 November 2019}}</ref> before starting a podcast called ''Freedomain Radio'' (FDR).<ref name="freedomainradio">{{cite web |url=https://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/0 |title=An Introduction to Freedomain Radio |website=Freedomainradio.com |accessdate=June 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619035740/https://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/0#/0 |archive-date=2018-06-19 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2010, Molyneux appeared on the [[Press TV]] program ''On the Edge'' hosted by [[Max Keiser]], and first participated on [[Alex Jones]]' [[InfoWars]] show the following year.

Molyneux has frequently hosted prominent [[White supremacy|white supremacist]]s on his podcast, such as [[Peter Brimelow]] (founder of the white-nationalist website [[VDARE]]), and [[Jared Taylor]] (founder of the white-supremacist magazine ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]'').<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|last=McDermott|first=Nathan|last2=Kaczynski|first2=Andrew|last3=Massie|first3=Chris|date=November 30, 2018|title=Rep.

=== Facts, Truth, Philiosophy, Freedom ===

Molyneux is known for his careful articulation of the facts of a matter as borne by his detailed research. He goes where the facts lead him, and on the basis of those facts, draw sometimes radically different conclusions from the mainstream media whom, unfortunately, tend not to be as meliticous as they perhaps should be.

Molyneux spends considerable efforts in speaking about classic philosophers, as is his training and passion. He has done an extensive podcast on Plato, for example.

Freedom is Molyneux's main goal. Freedom though disclipine in the individual holding off on instant gratification today in order to plan for a better and more prosperous future.

According to ''The New York Times'', Molyneux is fixated with "race realism".  He has hosted white supremacists such as [[Jared Taylor]] on his show.  Molyneux has blamed "rap culture" for unarmed black men getting shot by police.<ref name=":3" />

[[Nassim Taleb]] argued that "Molyneux thinks he can manage to keep ... catering to a [[Nordicism|Nordist supremacist]] following ... yet claim this is not racist so he doesn't get banned from social media".<ref>{{cite tweet |user=nntaleb |number=1079734921143431168 |date= 31 Dec 2018|title= Molyneux }}</ref>

[[indy100]] describes Molyneux as a provocateur who "has been allowed to promote a racist, transphobic, misogynistic and Islamophobic agenda on various platforms but has started to see his revenue diminish," while including a tweet by Molyneux in which he asserts that he is not a "white nationalist" in response to being banned from a popular platform.<ref name="newsletter" />

=== Men's rights activism ===
Molyneux describes himself as a [[Men's rights movement|men's rights activist]].<ref name=":3" /> He was a panelist at a 2014 Detroit conference held by the [[men's rights movement]] and [[manosphere]] organization, [[A Voice for Men]]. According to Jessica Roy of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Molyneux argued that violence in the world is the result of how women treat their children, and that: "If we could just get people to be nice to their babies for five years straight, that would be it for war, drug abuse, addiction, promiscuity, sexually transmitted diseases, ... Almost all would be completely eliminated, because they all arise from dysfunctional early childhood experiences, which are all run by women".<ref name="men">{{cite news |last=Roy |first=Jessica |date=July 2, 2014 |title=What I Learned as a Woman at a Men's-Rights Conference |url=http://time.com/2949435/what-i-learned-as-a-woman-at-a-mens-rights-conference/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=May 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608215558/http://time.com/2949435/what-i-learned-as-a-woman-at-a-mens-rights-conference/ |archive-date=2018-06-08 |url-status=live }}</ref> Molyneux believes feminism is a form of socialism.<ref name=":3" />

=== Family-of-origin relationships ===
Molyneux refers to the family that people are born into as their "family-of-origin", or "FOO". He suggests that family-of-origin relationships may not necessarily be desirable, and under given circumstances may even be detrimental, and thus, for those individuals unsatisfied with their childhood relationships, it would be advantageous for them to sever such involuntary relationships as adults, or "deFOO".<ref name=Guardian-2008>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/15/family-relationships-fdr-defoo-cult |title=You will never see me again |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=January 7, 2009 |first=Kate |last=Hilpern |date=November 15, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131223212938/http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/15/family-relationships-fdr-defoo-cult |archive-date=2013-12-23 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{efn|Molyneux is quoted saying, "Family relationships are voluntary and you should really work, if you're unhappy in these relationships, to improve the quality of those relationships – but to remember they do remain voluntary. And that gives people the motivation, I think, to try to improve them. But if you can't improve them – and we can't change other people, as we all know – for sure you should have the option to disengage."<ref name="Guardian-2008" />}} In this way, he views all adult relationships as being voluntary and discretionary rather than obligatory. Molyneux has been quoted saying: 
{{quote|text=Deep down I do not believe that there are any really good parents out there – the same way that I do not believe there were any really good doctors in the 10th century.<ref name="Guardian-2008" />}}

A disciplinary panel at the [[College of Psychologists of Ontario]] spoke critically of "deFOOing" after a professional investigation into Molyneux's wife,<ref name="tgamlawsuit" /><ref name="tgamreprimand">{{cite news |last=Rodan |first=Galit |date=November 1, 2012 |title=Therapist who told podcast listeners to shun their families reprimanded|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/therapist-who-told-podcast-listeners-to-shun-their-families-reprimanded/article4846791/ |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |access-date=November 26, 2019}}</ref> saying that by the standards of the College, it "may be appropriate to recommend family separation in cases of abuse" only after a suitable evaluation of patient history to "ascertain whether the advice [is] warranted in the circumstances".<ref>{{cite court |litigants=In the matter of The Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991, S.O. 1991, Chapter 18 and the Psychology Act, 1991, S.O. 1991, Chapter 38; and in the matter of Ms. Christina Papadopoulos, Psychological Associate; and in the matter of a hearing before a panel of the Discipline Committee of the College of Psychologists of Ontario concerning allegations of professional misconduct against Christina Papadopoulos, Psychological Associate as set out in the Amended Notice of Hearing dated May 17, 2012 |date=October 31, 2012 <!-- Note: The public register is dated differently to the hearing. --> |court=[[College of Psychologists of Ontario]] |url=https://members.cpo.on.ca/public_register/investigation_detail/124}}</ref> According to a 2008 article in ''[[The Guardian]]'', both Molyneux and his wife have dissociated from their families of origin.<ref name=Guardian-2008 />

==Cult accusations==

According to [[Steven Hassan]], a mental health counselor with experience on cults, "Partly what's going on with the people on the Internet who are indoctrinated, they spend lots of hours on the computer. Videos can have them up all night for several nights in a row. Molyneux knows how to talk like he knows what he's talking about, despite very little academic research. He cites this and cites that, and presents it as the whole truth. It dismantles people's sense of self and replaces it with his sense of confidence about how to fix the world".<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/meet-the-cult-leader-stumping-for-donald-trump|title=Meet the 'Cult' Leader Stumping for Donald Trump|last1=Collins|first1=Ben|date=5 February 2016|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=19 June 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012231804/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/05/meet-the-cult-leader-stumping-for-donald-trump.html|archivedate=2016-10-12|language=en}}</ref>

In 2009, Tu Thanh Ha wrote that Molyneux was called the leader of a "therapy cult" after Tom Bell, a Freedomain Radio community member, severed contact with his family.<ref name="Globe-2008" /> In April 2008, Bell had called in to the show asking about his [[veganism]] and his feeling of disgust towards people who eat meat.<ref name="Times-2009">{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-mother-and-son-torn-apart-by-web-cult-that-destroys-families-w8klkzndf50|title=The mother and son torn apart by web 'cult' that destroys families|last=Whipple|first=Tom|date=January 10, 2009|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|access-date=October 19, 2019|url-access=subscription}}</ref> Molyneux suggested that this disgust could have come from witnessing an authority figure who was cruel to animals.<ref name="Times-2009" /> Bell responded by describing memories of his father being verbally and physically cruel to the family cat, causing him to feel intimidated by the father, and then described his [[emotional detachment]] toward his mother and the rest of his family.<ref name="Times-2009" />

The following month, Bell left a note stating he no longer wanted contact and left home referring to Molyneux's concept of  "deFOOing".<ref name=Times-2009 /> It was reported that, of the estimated 50,000 users of the website, about 20 (0.04%) FDR members had also disassociated from their families-of-origin, and that many parents chose not to speak to the media in an effort to avoid alienating their children further.<ref name=Times-2009 /> The British [[Cult Information Centre]] (CIC) has described Freedomain Radio as a cult.<ref name="Vice20170811">{{cite news|last=Lamoureux|first=Mack|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/wjj85y/youtube-has-become-a-breeding-ground-for-digital-cults|title=How Cults Use YouTube for Recruitment|work=Vice|date=August 11, 2017|access-date=June 30, 2020}}</ref> A representative of the CIC said they were following FDR, and said that one sign of cults was that they cut people off from their families. Molyneux responded by saying, "If I advised a wife to leave an abusive husband, there would not be articles about how I am a cult leader".<ref name="Times-2009" />

Molyneux and "deFOOing" were subjects of an investigative documentary by [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in the [[United Kingdom]], which aired on August 20, 2015.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.channel5.com/show/trapped-in-a-cult/|title=Trapped In A Cult?|date=2015-08-20|publisher=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119211815/http://www.channel5.com/shows/trapped-in-a-cult|archive-date=2015-11-19|accessdate=2015-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Wyatt |first=Daisy |date=August 20, 2015 |title=Trapped in a Cult? – TV review: Disappointing Channel 5 shock-doc fails to come up to scratch |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/trapped-in-a-cult-tv-review-disappointing-channel-5-shock-doc-fails-to-come-up-to-scratch-10464473.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118201100/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/trapped-in-a-cult-tv-review-disappointing-channel-5-shock-doc-fails-to-come-up-to-scratch-10464473.html |archive-date=2015-11-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> The same subjects were also featured on the February 18, 2016 episode of the documentary series ''[[Dark Net (TV series)|Dark Net]]''.

Having now reviewed it, I note that I was accurate in stating that the College did not say that "deFOOing" is never appropriate. Rather, it was found that, "While it may be appropriate to recommend family separation in cases of abuse, the Member did not obtain a sufficient history to ascertain whether the advice was warranted in the circumstances discussed in the podcasts." ||https://www.freedomain.com/all-podcasts/#/2778/the-joe-rogan-experience-with-stefan-molyneux-538||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnbR_j12JXk&feature=youtu.be&t=0m0s

|3056 || Phyllis Schlafly || Rise of the Left, Death of the Family | A Conversation with Phyllis Schlafly - In the last hundred years, the American family has been attacked, debased, maligned, slandered, and vilified by every facet of society. No family is safe from the official busybodies. 'Who Killed the American Family' reveals the concerted assault on the American nuclear family by many forces - feminists, judges, lawmakers, psychologists, school districts, college professors, politicians offering incentives and seeking votes, and more - opposed to the traditional American nuclear family, each with its own raison d'etre for wanting to abolish it. The wreckage of the American family leaves us with the inability to have limited government because government steps in to perform tasks formerly done by the nuclear family.

|4025 ||Richard Haier || The Neuroscience of Intelligence | Richard Haier and Stefan Molyneux.  The Neuroscience of Intelligence Summary: "Compelling evidence shows that genetics plays a more important role than environment as intelligence develops from childhood, and that intelligence test scores correspond strongly to specific features of the brain assessed with neuroimaging. In understandable language, Richard J. Haier explains cutting-edge techniques based on genetics, DNA, and imaging of brain connectivity and function. He dispels common misconceptions, such as the belief that IQ tests are biased or meaningless, and debunks simple interventions alleged to increase intelligence. Readers will learn about the real possibility of dramatically enhancing intelligence based on neuroscience findings and the positive implications this could have for education and social policy. The text also explores potential controversies surrounding neuro-poverty, neuro-socioeconomic status, and the morality of enhancing intelligence for everyone. Online resources, including additional visuals, animations, questions and links, reinforce the material." ||https://www.freedomain.com/all-podcasts/#/4025/the-neuroscience-of-intelligence-richard-haier-and-stefan-molyneux}}{\f||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQI6nGak8sU&feature=youtu.be&t=0m0s

There are three institutions in American life run by gatekeepers who have stopped letting in anyone who questions their liberal script: academia, journalism, and pop culture. They use their cult-like groupthink consensus as 'proof' that science, reporting, and entertainment will always back up the Democrats. They give their most political members awards, and then say the awards make their liberal beliefs true. Worse, they are using that consensus to pull the country even further to the left, by bullying and silencing dissent from even those they've allowed in. ...

Why do skeptical and relativistic arguments have such power in the contemporary intellectual world? Why do they have that power in the humanities but not in the sciences? Why has a significant portion of the political Left - the same Left that traditionally promoted reason, science, equality for all, and optimism - now switched to themes of anti-reason, anti-science, double standards, and cynicism? Explaining Postmodernism is intellectual history with a polemical twist, providing fresh insights into the debates underlying the furor over political correctness, multiculturalism, and the future of liberal democracy." ||https://www.freedomain.com/all-podcasts/#/4157/postmodernisms-dangerous-history-stephen-hicks-and-stefan-molyneux||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkfH87CgKOQ&feature=youtu.be&t=0m0s

That year, their target was Lincoln. They smeared him. They went to war to defeat him. In the end, they assassinated him. Now the target of the Democrats is President Trump and his supporters. The Left calls them racists, white supremacists and fascists. These charges are used to justify driving Trump from office and discrediting the right "by any means necessary." ||https://www.freedomain.com/all-podcasts/#/4165/death-of-a-nation-dinesh-dsouza-and-stefan-molyneux||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiZdmq4p8Y&feature=youtu.be&t=0m0s

|4175 ||Ernst Roets ||The Crisis In South Africa | Ernst Roets and Stefan Molyneux.  "Kill the Boer is a book about the brutal reality of farm attacks in South Africa and how the South African government is complicit to this crisis. It is argued that the South African government should be regarded as complicit due to a variety of reasons, including its deprioritising of the crisis despite the worsening thereof, negative stereotyping of white farmers in particular, romanticising of violence inflicted upon farmers, propagation of hatred from political platforms, as well as the scorning and ridiculing of the victims of these attacks. The book reveals accounts of the direct involvement of members of the ruling ANC, the South African government and the SAPS in particular with the planning and execution of these attacks. It is argued that a looming process of ethnic cleansing should be regarded as a serious threat and something to be prevented. The complicity of the South African media is also indicated by analysis of news reports which clearly indicate biased reporting, leading to vilification and negative stereotyping of white farmers in particular. A variety of reasons why farm attacks are unique and deserving to be treated as a priority crime are outlined. These include the unique frequency at which these attacks take place, the horrific levels of torture that often accompanies these crimes, the role  that farmers should play in society and the unique circumstances that farmers are in." ||https://www.freedomain.com/all-podcasts/#/4175/the-crisis-in-south-africa-ernst-roets-and-stefan-molyneux||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mnTeXdjJsI&feature=youtu.be&t=0m0s
