** Intro
   No code here. Just my thoughts, musings, etc. on what I deem to be powerful ideas.
   You will either think me a genius or totally and utterly mad. There will be
   nothing in between, I think.

   Note that I am just getting started here, so many things will be blank or
   not filled in yet. This is an ongoing process which I only just begun.

** Why am I doing this
   I have simply too many innovative ideas and thoughts that are scattered records-wise.
   Many of them are scattered across audio notes over the decades. And also in various
   social media sites. It is high time I gather them all and write them down in one place,
   along with the formalization and attendant research that must be done. Also, this
   serves as a type of authentication of these ideas, since it is on GitHub.
   The history, at least from the point of these posts, are clear to see.

** Who am I?
   I am the Autodidactic Anarchistic Atheist. The most dangerous man alive.

   Seriously, that is a paraphrase of the description of Neo from the first 
   of The Matrix movies. I do see myself as a combination of Neo and Morpheus.
   Assuming I am not just in the throes of my own delusions, there may be
   more truth in my tag line than even I am willing to admit.

   Or I may be nothing more than a cantankerous old fool, a crank. I like to think
   of myself as "The Fool on a Hill". And kudos if you understand that reference.

   You decide.
*** Origins of me
    I have been living in Germany for -- as of this writing -- 6 years. I came
    here from the Boston area. I love it here in Germany and in Europe in general,
    but no place is perfect. There's lots I don't like, but then there's lots 
    I don't like about the US, and about everywhere else that I have been.

    So it's a matter of picking one's poison.
*** What do I want to be when I grow up?
    Pinky and the Brain had some smart ideas! Something like that...
*** The World as I see it.
    Well, if you recognize that title, you have also probably guessed 
    that I am a bit fan of Einstein, and you will be correct in that
    regard.

    My views are similar to his, for the most part. And I have yet
    to visit his birth place in Ulm. But Ulm is not going anywhere, and
    alas, there is not much to see there. It will be satisfying to 
    just walk in the same place he did so long ago.

    I have visited Princeton University, but I don't get the flavor of 
    Einstein there. It's nothing like it was in Einstein's day.

***** Gender Politics
      While I know that a small number of individuals suffer from gender dysphoria -- including
      one of my kids, I am annoyed by the level of derisive politics that has arisen around
      this issue world-wide -- or at least in America and Europe.

      They are all hell-bent on murdering the language we speak daily. So far, I know this to be
      the case in both the US and Germany. Murdering the German language is tricky, because nouns
      have 3 genders -- masculine, feminine, and neuter. I don't know how far it will get.

      There may be similar efforts in France, but I have no confirmation on this.
***** Leftists
      There is a difference between liberals and leftists.
      - liberals - I disagree with what you have to say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.
      - leftists - I disagree with what you have to say, and I will do damage to you  if you don't shut up.
        
      Now, I myself am a libertarian (really, a Fractopolist, but that's a work in progress now). I do
      consider that all have a right to their own opinions, but also a responsibility for not only the
      actions they take, but also to make sure their opinions have merit, changing them if they do not.

      These are unenforceable admonishments, of course. As long as all adhere to the Non-Aggression Principle,
      as in never initiating aggression against another, you are free to think whatever you want and do whatever 
      you want.

*** Einstein, as I see him
** Who are you?
** Some new ideas to explore
   These new ideas will eventually be placed into their own separate .org
   files as they mature and grow.
*** Come up with an alternative for Scrum / Agile that will allow introverts be introverts
    I think this is a real issue, because most software developers tend
    to be introverted anyway. Not everone is a leader. Not everyone wants
    to be so interactive with others all the time. And yet, how do we allow
    for this, and at the same time allow the introvert to be the most productive?
    
    For myself, who had to learn extroversion as an introvert, the daily
    standup can be very disruptive to my flow. And yet, most places require you to do
    the daily standups. This might be useful, maybe, to junior developers, but not
    seasoned professionals like myself. And is it really that useful to them?

    Why not just have an internal group chat system setup -- and many places already have
    this in place anyway -- where individuals can come forth with problems, and even
    report progress AT THE END OF THE DAY?

    That's another thing -- normally, standups are held in the morning. So whatever progress
    I made the prior day I may have forgotten about by morning, and I usually forget an important
    detail or two. So perhaps doing it all online with Slack or Rocket Chat would be
    much better.

    I think that the CoVID-19 scare may have forced some of this into place, but will things
    go back to "business as usual" when this crisis is over? That remains to be seen.

    But I deem that the entire Scrum / Agile methodology needs a bit of reworking to
    make the work environment better for introverts, and everyone in general.

*** A principle of work challenge for the Software Engineer
    A long time ago, I came up with the following aphorism:
    
    If you are good enough to do the job,
    you are not dumb enough to do the job.

    Many occupations fall under this rubric. For example, "tech" support. If
    you are actually smart enough to properly do tech support, you are smart enough
    to find better jobs that will pay you far more for your knowledge. Plus, you
    would probably be bored at just doing tech support.
    
    So what happens? They hire flunkies and give them scripts to follow. Really dain-brammaged
    mind-numbing scripts, such as:

    1. Is your computer plugged in?
    2. Is your computer turned on?
    3. Did you delete and reinstall the software / clear your cookie cache?

    And once you jump though those silly hoops that you have already covered,
    then and only then do you progress to a "tier 2" service. Oh, after you are
    on hold for 30 minutes!!!!

    But I digress.

    Now, here is a similar principle for software developers and the level of 
    jobs available. You see, the firm will structure things in such a way that they
    can get away with hiring the weakest and cheapest candidates. They don't
    want do something that would require a PhD level of knowledge for the most part.

    Of course, sometimes they have no choice. Like, for instance, creating an
    automonous driving system. But even in this case, they will hire just a few 
    super-experts, and replicate that system to everyone else, and the pre-canned 
    system will only require those of lesser expertise to basically "glue" it in to
    whatever specific hardware there is at hand.

    Similar situation with machine learning. The super-experts will develop all the
    machine learning algorithms in C or C++, and then do Python bindings so any old
    dummy can actually use the libraries / frameworks.
    
    I am not sure what to call this yet. But I am sure I will think fo something.
       
** Closing thoughts
   This is my attempts to solidify the many thoughs, notions, flashes of inspirations, 
   and the like that goes on in my head all the time. This will always be a "work 
   in progress" because none of this is ever expected to be static or completed.
   Onward and upward!
