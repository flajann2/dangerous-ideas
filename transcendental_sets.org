** Synopsis
   Transcendental Sets is something I've been chewing on for the past 
   two decades. More on this later.
** History
** In Depth  
*** Realms and Hierarchy
**** Emergence
*** Temporal Relationships
*** Ingress and Egress
**** Costs of Transitions
*** Sparsity
    I note that there is sparsity in space and sparsity in the brain. I think this
    is important to Trsandental Sets. I do have a small write-up on sparse systems,
    so we should probably consult that for some ideas.
